# Custom YOLOv8 for Enhanced Object Detection

## Overview

This project enhances the YOLOv8 model for specific object detection tasks in images and videos. The customization is aimed at improving detection accuracy in designated domains such as sports or public safety by fine-tuning the model on a targeted dataset. The repository includes scripts for training, testing, and deploying the model, as well as for converting it into different formats for various deployment environments.

## Use Case

The modified YOLOv8 model is highly versatile and can be adapted to various scenarios:
- **Sports Analysis**: Automatically detect sports equipment or player actions in real-time to enhance coaching and game analysis.
- **Public Safety Monitoring**: Use in surveillance systems to detect activities or items of interest, potentially improving response times in emergency situations.
- **Wildlife Observation**: Employ in automated systems to monitor wildlife, helping researchers track animal movements and behaviors without human intervention.

## Features

- **Customized Object Detection**: Detects objects based on custom criteria set during the training phase.
- **Image and Video Processing**: Capable of processing both still images and video streams to locate and identify objects.
- **High Accuracy and Speed**: Optimized for both high accuracy and processing speed, suitable for real-time applications.
- **Export to ONNX**: Includes functionality to export the trained model to the ONNX format for easy deployment across different platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- ultralytics YOLOv8 library
- tqdm for progress bars

## Dataset Setup
Prepare your dataset by organizing it into the appropriate structure expected by the training script:

./yolo_data/images/train/: Training images
./yolo_data/labels/train/: Corresponding labels for training images
Repeat the same for validation and test sets.

## How it works

1. Model Training: Trains the YOLOv8 model using a custom dataset tailored for specific object detection tasks.
2. Detection: Uses the trained model to identify and locate objects in new images or videos.
3. Exporting Model: Converts the trained model into the ONNX format for use in different deployment environments.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/yolov8_custom_detection.git
